## Description

The Personal Blog is a browser-based application that encourages Users to enter individual Blog Posts, accessible to all Users of the site. As developed, the Posts are only accessible through a local instance, specific to each accessing computer.

Blog Posts are held in the Local Storage and, consequently, not currently accessible through the Web.

The Personal Blog source code is published on GitHub, and may be cloned to individual User computers to instantiate local versions.

Blog Posts are entered through a dedicated Form-page, and aggregated on the site Home Page.

The Personal Blog features a sequential, timeline-based view of Blog Posts, and provides Light and Dark Mode options.

The app utlizes an HTML-based Form to ingest User Input, JavaScript to push Blog Posts to Local Storage, and dynamically update the Home Page with new Posts, and CSS to style to site. JavaScript is also used to enable Light and Dark Modes.

Because Blog Posts are held in Local Storage, entries will persist across User sessions on individual, hosting computers.


## Installation

The Personal Blog source code may be downloaded from its GitHub repository, and run directly by a hosting computer.

No Installation of the Personal Blog is required; the app is fully browser-based, accessed through any modern browser that supports JavaScript.


## Usage

The Personal Blog is intended for use by one or more Users to record personal reflections that will be held locally, and persist across multiple sessions. 

All Users of the Personal Blog on a local computer will have full visibility to all Users' Posts.
